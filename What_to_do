1) The program starts good, but in course of action begin to a little freeze with fpsdrop. Need to find solution.
2) Drivers now CAN NOT change their roadline. This sucks. Need to add option to change line.
3) Ashot or Hellrider is not behaved.
4)Colision dtection can be bad, really.

In this point the program is just good-looking road simulation without any conflicts.
